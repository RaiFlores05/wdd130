                <h2>More Than Normal Person</h2>
                <p>The musicians create an incredible era from the year 0 of the world. For example, Mozart, Bethoven, Chopin, are composers of the classical and romantic season of the 1600s, 1700s. I think everyone knows who they are. But today we know Michael Jackson (king of pop), Queen, Madonna, Prince, Elvis Presley and many more musicians. Each one has something that they put into their music and we feel that, that's why we love them.</p>
